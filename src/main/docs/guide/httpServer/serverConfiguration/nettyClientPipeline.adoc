You can customize the Netty client pipeline by writing a <<events, Bean Event Listener>> that listens for the creation of api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[].

Both the Netty HTTP server and client implement this interface and it lets you customize the Netty `ChannelPipeline` and add additional handlers. Use for the server is deprecated in favor of api:io.micronaut.http.server.netty.NettyServerCustomizer[].

The api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[] interface defines constants for the names of the various handlers Micronaut registers.

As an example the following code sample demonstrates registering the https://github.com/zalando/logbook[Logbook] library which includes additional Netty handlers to perform request and response logging:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.netty.LogbookPipelineCustomizer[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="Customizing the Netty pipeline for Logbook"]

<1> `LogbookPipelineCustomizer` listens for a api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[] and requires the definition of a `Logbook` bean
<2> Use of api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[] is deprecated for the server. Use a api:http.server.netty.ServerNettyCustomizer[] instead.
<3> if the bean being created is the client, the client handler is registered

WARNING: Logbook has a https://github.com/zalando/logbook/issues/1216[major bug] that limits its usefulness with netty.
